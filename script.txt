OLDER TED: Kids, I'm gonna tell you an incredible story
The story of how I met your mother
- Are we being punished for something
- No
- Yeah, is this gonna take a while
- Yes
Twenty-five years ago, before I was Dad, I had this whole other life
It was way back in 2005
I was 27, just starting to make it as an architect and living in New York with Marshall, my best friend from college
My life was good
And then Uncle Marshall went and screwed the whole thing up
Will you marry me
Yes
Perfect
And then you're engaged, you pop the champagne, you drink a toast, you have sex on the kitchen floor
- Don't have sex on our kitchen floor
- Got it
Thanks for helping me plan this out, Ted
Dude, are you kidding
It's you and Lily
I've been there for all the big moments of you and Lily
The night you met, your first date, other first things
Yeah, sorry, we thought you were asleep
It's physics, Marshall
If the bottom bunk moves, the top bunk moves, too
My God, you're getting engaged tonight
Yeah
What are you doing tonight
What was I doing
Here, Uncle Marshall was taking the biggest step of his life
And me
I'm calling up your Uncle Barney
Hey, so you know how I've always had a thing for half-Asian girls
Well, now I've got a new favorite
Lebanese girls
Lebanese girls are the new half-Asians
Hey, you wanna do something tonight
Okay, meet me at the bar in 15 minutes
And suit up
- Hey
- Where's your suit
Just once, when I say 'suit up,' I wish you'd put on a suit
- I did
That one time
- It was a blazer
You know, ever since college it's been Marshall and Lily and me
Now it's gonna be Marshall and Lily and me
They'll get married, start a family
Before long, I'm that weird middle-aged bachelor their kids call 'Uncle Ted
I see what this is about
Have you forgotten what I said to you the night we met
Ted, I'm gonna teach you how to live
- Barney
We met at the urinal
- Oh, right
Hi
Lesson one, lose the goatee
It doesn't go with your suit
- I'm not wearing a suit
- Lesson two, get a suit
Suits are cool
Exhibit A
Lesson three, don't even think about getting married till you're 30
Thirty
Right, you're right
I guess it's just, your best friend gets engaged, - you start thinking about that stuff
- I thought I was your best friend
Ted, say I'm your best friend
- You're my best friend, Barney
- Good
Then as your best friend, I suggest we play a little game I like to call, 'Have you met Ted
No, no, no, no, we're not playing 'Have you met Ted
Hi, have you met Ted
- Hi, I'm Ted
- Yasmin
- It's a very pretty name
- Thanks
It's Lebanese
Hey
(GROANS) I'm exhausted
It was finger-painting day at school and a 5-year-old boy got to second base with me
- Wow, you're cooking
- Yes, I am
Are you sure that's a good idea after last time
You looked really creepy without eyebrows
I can handle this
I think you'll find I'm full of surprises tonight
So there's more surprises
Like what
Marshall was in his second year of law school, so he was pretty good at thinking on his feet
Boogedy boo
And that's all of them
I'm gonna go cook
I'm so happy for Marshall, I really am
I just couldn't imagine settling down right now
- So do you think you'll ever get married
- Well, maybe eventually
Some fall day
Possibly in Central Park
Simple ceremony
We'll write our own vows
Band, no DJ
People will dance, I'm not gonna worry about it
Damn it, why did Marshall have to get engaged
Yeah, nothing hotter than a guy planning out his own imaginary wedding, huh
- Actually, I think it's cute
- Well, you're clearly drunk
One more for the lady
Oh, hey, look what I got
Oh, honey, champagne
Yeah
No, you are too old to be scared to open a bottle of champagne
I'm not scared
- Then open it
- Fine
Please, open it
Gosh, you are unbelievable, Marshall
There are two big questions a man has to ask in life
One you plan out for months, the other just slips out when you're half-drunk at some bar
Will you marry me
You wanna go out sometime
Of course, you idiot
I'm sorry, Carl's my boyfriend
What's up, Carl
I promised Ted we wouldn't do that
Did you know there's a Pop-Tart under your fridge
No, but dibs
Where's that champagne
I wanna drink a toast with my fiancÃ©e
I don't know why I was so scared of this
It's pretty easy, right
(LILY SCREAMING) Why am I freaking out all of a sudden
This is crazy
I'm not ready to settle down
How does Carl land a Lebanese girl
The plan's always been don't even think about it until you're 30
Exactly
The guy doesn't even own a suit
Plus, Marshall's found the love of his life
Even if I was ready, which I'm not, but if I was, it's like, 'Okay, I'm ready
Where is she
And there she was
It was like something from an old movie where the sailor sees the girl across the crowded dance floor, turns to his buddy and says, 'See that girl
I'm gonna marry her someday
Hey, Barney, see that girl
Oh, yeah
You just know she likes it dirty
- Go say hi
- I can't just go say hi
I need a plan
I'm gonna wait until she goes to the bathroom, then I'll strategically place myself by the jukebox so that Hi, have you met Ted
Hi
Let me guess
Ted
I'm sorry, Lily
I'm so sorry
Take us to the hospital
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Did you hit her
Hit me
Please
This guy can barely even spank me in bed for fun
He's all, like, 'Oh, honey, did that hurt
And I'm, like, 'Come on, let me have you, you pansy
- Wow, a complete stranger
- No, no, no, it's okay
Go on
So, these spankings, are you in pajamas or au natural
- So what do you do
- I'm a reporter for Metro News 1
- Oh
- Well, kind of a reporter
I do those dumb little fluff pieces at the end of the news
You know, like, 'Monkey who can play the ukulele
But I'm hoping to get some bigger stories soon
Bigger, like, 'Gorilla with an upright bass
Sorry
You're really pretty
- Oh, your friends don't seem too happy
- Yeah
See, the one in the middle just got dumped by her boyfriend
So tonight, every guy is 'the enemy
You know, if it'll make your friend feel better you could throw a drink in my face
I don't mind
She would love that
And it does look fun in the movies
Hey, you wanna have dinner with me Saturday night
Oh, I can't
I'm going to Orlando for a week on Friday
Some guy's attempting to make the world's biggest pancake
- Guess who's covering it
- That's gonna take a week
Yeah, he's gonna eat it, too
It's another record
Hey, what's taking so long
I know this is a long shot, but how about tomorrow night
Yeah
What the hell
Jerk
That was fun
De Wait for it nied
Denied
We're going out tomorrow night
I thought we were playing Lazer Tag tomorrow night
Yeah, I was never gonna go play Lazer Tag
The next night, I took her out to this little bistro in Brooklyn
Wow
- That is one bad-ass blue French horn
- Yeah
Sort of looks like a Smurf penis
Son, a piece of advice
When you go on a first date, you really don't want to say Smurf penis
Girls don't ordinarily like that
But this was no ordinary girl
Lily
How long have you been sitting there
Stupid eye patch
Mom, Dad, I have found the future Mrs
Ted Mosby
Marshall, how have I always described my perfect woman
Let's see
She likes dogs
I've got five dogs
She drinks Scotch
I love a Scotch that's old enough to order its own Scotch
Can quote obscure lines from Ghostbusters
'Ray, when someone asks you if you're a God, you say, 'Yes
And I'm saving the best for last
Do you want these
I hate olives
- She hates olives
Awesome
- The Olive Theory
The Olive Theory is based on my friends, Marshall and Lily
He hates olives, she loves them
And in a weird way, that's what makes them such a great couple
Perfect balance
You know, I've had a jar of olives just sitting in my fridge forever
I could take them off your hands
They're all yours
Oh, it is on
It is on till the break of dawn
But, wait, it's only the break of 10:30
What happened
I gotta get one of those blue French horns for over my fireplace
It's gotta be blue, it's gotta be French
- No green clarinet
- Nope
Come on, no purple tuba
It's a Smurf penis or no dice
There you are
We got a jumper
Some crazy guy on the Manhattan Bridge
Come on, you're covering it
All right, I'll be right there
I'm sorry
I had a really great time tonight
Yeah, well
So, did you kiss her
No, the moment wasn't right
Look, this woman could actually be my future wife
I want our first kiss to be amazing
Oh, Ted, that is so sweet
So, you chickened out like a little bitch
What
I did not chicken out
You know what
I don't need to take first kiss advice from some pirate who hasn't been single since the first week of college
Ted, anyone who's single would tell you the same thing
Even the dumbest single person alive
And if you don't believe me, call him
Hey, loser, how's not playing Lazer Tag
Because playing Lazer Tag is awesome
Oh, I killed you, Connor
Don't make me get your mom
Hey, listen, I need your opinion on something
Okay, meet me at the bar in 15 minutes
And suit up
So, these guys think I chickened out
What do you think
I can't believe you're still not wearing a suit
She didn't even give me the signal
What, is she gonna bat her eyes at you in Morse code
'Ted, 'kiss me
- No, you just kiss her
- Not if you don't get the signal
- Did Marshall give me the signal
- No
I didn't, I swear
But, see, at least tonight, I get to sleep knowing Marshall and me, never gonna happen
You should've kissed her
I should've kissed her
Well, maybe in a week when she gets back from Orlando
A week
That's like a year in hot-girl time
She'll forget all about you
Mark my words, you will never see that one again
There she is
She's cute
Hey, Carl, turn it up
persuaded him to reconsider
At which point the man came down off the ledge, giving this bizarre story a happy ending
Reporting from Metro 1 News, - back to you, Bill
- The guy didn't jump
I'm gonna go kiss her
- Right now
- Look, dude, it's midnight
As your future lawyer, I'm gonna advise you that's freaking crazy
I never do anything crazy
I'm always waiting for the moment, planning the moment
Well, she's leaving tomorrow and this may be the only moment I'm gonna get
I gotta do what that guy couldn't
I gotta take the leap
Okay, not a perfect metaphor 'cause for me it's fall in love and get married and for him it's death
Actually, that is a perfect metaphor
By the way, did I congratulate you two
- I'm doing this
- Let's go
- Word up
- We're coming with you
Barney
All right, but under one condition
Look at you, you beautiful bastard, you suited up
This is totally going in my blog
Stop the car
Pull over right here
I gotta do something
Excuse me
Pardon me, just a sec
- Enjoy your coffee
- Hey
Hey
Go, go, go
Everybody brings flowers
Okay, moment of truth
- Wish me luck
- Ted's gonna get it on with a TV reporter
'This just in
Okay
- Kiss her, Ted
Kiss her good
- Kiss the crap out of that girl
Marshall, remember this night
When you're the best man at our wedding and you give a speech, you're gonna tell this story
Why does he get to be the best man
I'm your best friend
As I waIked up to that door, a million thoughts raced through my mind
Unfortunately, one particular thought did not
I've got five dogs
(DOGS BARKING) Not good, not good
- No
- Get back in there
You're wearing a suit
ROBIN: Ted
Hi
I was just Come on up
MARSHALL: He's in
So, Ranjit, you must have done it with a Lebanese girl
Okay, that's my Barney limit
I'm gonna see if that bodega has a bathroom
Actually, I'm from Bangladesh
- The women hot there
- Here's a picture of my wife
(WHISPERING) A simple 'no' would have sufficed
She's lovely
So, Ted, what brings you back to Brooklyn at 1:00 in the morning in a suit
I was just hoping to get those olives that you said I could have
Would you like those olives with some gin and vermouth
Are you trying to get me drunk
For starters
(MUSIC PLAYING) Thank you
So, Marshall, this Olive Theory based on you and Lily
- Yeah
- You hate olives
- Lily loves them, you can't stand them
- Yeah, I hate olives
Two weeks ago, Spanish bar on 79th Street
Dish of olives
You had some
What up
You have to swear that this does not leave this cab
- I swear
- I swear
On our first date, I ordered a Greek salad
Lily asked if she could have my olives
I said, 'Sure, I hate olives
But you like olives
Well, I was 18, okay
I was a virgin
Been waiting my whole life for a pretty girl to want my olives
Marshall, I'm gonna give you an early wedding present
Don't get married
I think I like your Olive Theory
I think I like your new French horn
I think I like your nose
I think I'm in love with you
What
What
What
Come on, man, you said your stomach's been hurting, right
You know what that is
Hunger
You're hungry for experience
Hungry for something new
Hungry for olives
But you're too scared to do anything about it
Yeah, I'm scared, okay
But when I think of spending the rest of my life with Lily, committing forever, no other women, doesn't scare me at all
I'm marrying that girl
Lily
Lily, I like olives
We'll make it work
(SIGHING) So, Orlando
You gonna hit Disney World
- You love me
- Oh, God
I can't believe I said that
Why did I say that
Who says that
- I should just go
- Hold on
Wait a minute
I promised you these
- Olives
- Yeah
Thanks
I love you
What is wrong with me
Why are we still sitting here
Let's go
We can still make last call
What do you say, Lil
'Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum'
- 'Cause you're a pirate
- Okay, eye patch gone
And we can't just abandon Ted
If it doesn't go well up there, he's gonna need some support
It's been, like, 20 minutes
Do you think they're doing it
You think they're doing it in front of the dogs
Doggie style
I knew this girl in college, she had this Golden Retriever Okay, we can go to the bar
Just stop taIking
Hit it, Ranjit
So, when you tell this story to your friends, could you avoid the word 'psycho'
I'd prefer 'eccentric
Goodnight, psycho
Great
- How do I get to the F train
- Oh
- Two blocks, that way and take a right
- Thanks
You know what
I'm done being single
I'm not good at it
Look, obviously, you can't tell a woman you just met you love her, but it sucks that you can't
I'll tell you something, though
If a woman, not you, just some hypothetical woman, were to bear with me through all this, I think I'd make a damn good husband because that's the stuff I'd be good at
Stuff like making her laugh and being a good father and waIking her five hypothetical dogs
Being a good kisser
- Everyone thinks they're a good kisser
- Oh, I've got references
Goodnight, Ted
- And I'm a good handshaker
- That's a pretty great handshake
And that was it
I'll probably never see her again
- What
- That was the signal
That long, lingering handshake
You should've kissed her
There's no such thing as the signal
But, yeah, that was the signal
Signal
Carl, thank you
There's something I gotta do
By the way, you should've kissed her
Carl, you guys weren't there
I am so turned on right now
Guys, trust me
I've seen the signal
- That was not the signal
- Yeah, Ted, we're not on you anymore
- To my fiancÃ©e
- To the future
To one hell of a night
That was not the signal
I asked her about it years later, and, yeah, that was the signal
I could've kissed her
But that's the funny thing about destiny, it happens whether you plan it or not
I mean, I never thought I'd see that girl again
But it turns out, I was just too close to the puzzle to see the picture that was forming
Because that, kids, is the true story of how I met your Aunt Robin
Aunt Robin
I thought this was how you met Mom
Will you relax
I'm getting to it
Like I said, it's a long story

MICHAEL: Tonight is the Dundies, the annual employee awards night here at Dunder Mifflin
And this is everybody's favorite day
Everybody looks forward to it, because, you know, a lot of the people here don't get trophies very often, like Meredith or Kevin
I mean, who's gonna give Kevin an award
Dunkin' Donuts
Plus, bonus, it's really, really funny
So I You know, an employee will go home and he'll tell his neighbor, "Hey, did you get an award
And the neighbor will say, "No, man
I mean, I slave all day
"Nobody notices me
The next thing you know, the employee smells something terrible coming from the neighbor's house
The neighbor's hanged himself due to lack of recognition
So, you ready for the Dundies
(SIGHS) PAM: You know what they say about a car wreck, where it's so awful you can't look away
The Dundies are like a car wreck that you wanna look away, but you have to stare at it because your boss is making you
(HOARSELY) Hey, hey, hey
It's Fat Halpert
What
Fat Halpert
Jim Halpert
So, why don't I take you on a tour of past Dundie winners
We got Fat Jim Halpert here
Jim, why don't you show off your Dundies to the camera
Oh, I can't, because I keep them hidden
I don't wanna look at them and get cocky
Oh, that's a good idea
And mine are at home in a display case above my bed
Yuck
TMI
TMI, my friends
TMI
Too Much Information
It's just easier to say TMI
I used to say, "Don't go there," but that's lame
And here we have Stanley the Manly
Now, Stanley is a Dundie All-Star
Aren't you, Stan
Why don't you show them some of your bling
I don't know where they are
I think I threw them out
No, you didn't
I think I did
Why did Say, we gotta order some more appeteasers this time
We ran out last year, remember
Yes, we should
You know what
I wanted one of those skillets of cheese, but when I got off-stage someone had eaten all of them
To Oscar Martinez, it's the Show Me The Money Award
Michael has taped every Dundies Awards, and now he's making me look through hours of footage to find highlights
song that I think we're gonna play for the ladies
Hit it, Dwight
(PLAYING FLUTE) A little bit of Pam all night long A little bit of Angela on the thing A little bit of Meredith everywhere This is the part where Kevin sat in front of the camcorder all night
It's great
A little bit of Roy eating chicken crispers A little bit of Kim with some ribs A little bit of It was you
Live and learn
It wasn't, I swear
Yeah, it was
So, what's the joke
You're not perfect, either
We're not laughing at you, Dwight
So, who are we laughing at
Just something somebody wrote
Who, Dave Barry
No, no
Just something that was written on the ladies' room wall
What is it
Who wrote it
It's kind of private
It's about Michael
(LAUGHING) That is defacement of company property, so you better tell me
Kelly, if you tell me, you'll be punished less
Okay, now I'm laughing at you
(PAM LAUGHING) Will Her Highness Jan Levinson-Gould be descending from her corporate throne this evening to visit us lowly serfs here at Dunder Mifflin, Scranton
JAN: (STUTTERING) It's a two-and-a-half-hour drive from New York, Michael
Well, you could take the bus, you could work on the way here, sleep on the way home
No
Come on, Jan, this is important
I mean, this is validation to my employees here that you and corporate approve of this
So But we don't approve of this, Michael
You only have the budget for one office party a year, so we're not paying for this
Um Could you Are you there
Yeah, I'm here
I just wanted to talk to you for a second about that
MICHAEL: What What is I mean, come on, Jan
What, it's a You're dropping an A-bomb on me here
Really
I'm dropping an atomic bomb on you
Well, yeah
I mean what is What No, you can't You already had a party on May 5th for no reason
No reason
It was the 05-05-05 party
And you also had a luau
It happens once every billion years
And you had a luau
And the Tsunami Relief fundraiser, which somehow lost a lot of money
Okay, no, that was a fun-raiser
I don't really understand that
I think I made that very clear in the flyers
Okay, well, I don't understand why anyone would have Fun
F-U-N
a Tsunami fun-raiser, Michael
Well, I think a lot of people I mean, that just doesn't make sense
were very affected by the footage
This is a little character I like to do
It is loosely based on Karnak, one of Carson's classic characters
Here we go
The PLO, the IRA, and the hotdog stand behind the warehouse
(RIPPING) Name three businesses that have better healthcare plans than Dunder Mifflin
Here's the problem
There's no open bar because of Jan
And it's the reason why comedy clubs have a two-drink minimum
We'll be fine, but I just wish people were gonna be drunk
PHYLLIS: Dwight, get out of here
No, no, no What are you doing in the ladies' room
It's not what you think
No
Why were you in there
What were you doing in there
You are a pervert
I am not
The Dundie Award for Longest Engagement goes to Pam Beesly
Pam, everybody
(MICHAEL WHOOPING) When is that girl gonna get married
That's what I have to say
Ah, Roy's accepting
Yes
MICHAEL: Thank you, Roy
Are there any words you'd like to say on Pam's behalf
ROY: We'll see you next year
MICHAEL: Yeah
(MICHAEL LAUGHING) Hope not
Hope not
I'm not changing that
That's the best one
No, it's hilarious
You're right
I just think, "World's Longest Engagement," we're all expecting it, you know
That's why it's funny
Every year that Roy and Pam don't get married, it gets funnier
Well, I'd think if you use the same jokes, it just comes across as lazy
Oh, "lazy
Uh-huh
Excuse me, everyone
Can I have your attention, please
I just wanted to say that the women in this office are terrible
Especially the ones who wrote that stuff about Michael on the bathroom wall
Having a bathroom is a privilege
It is called a ladies' room for a reason, and if you cannot behave like ladies, well, then you are not going to have a bathroom
You're taking away our bathroom
We are going to have two men's rooms
But where would we go
Be prepared to hold it, folks
From 9:00 a
M Okay, okay, look PAM: Michael
Yes
Dwight's banning us from our bathroom
Okay, well, that's ridiculous
So, just don't I don't have time for this right now
There needs to be repercussions for people's behavior
Just don't talk, don't talk Okay, look, I know there have been a lot of rumors flying around about the Dundies this year
How there is no money, and how there is no food, and how the jokes are really bad
But, what the hell, everybody
I mean, God
The Dundies are about the best in every one of us
Can't you see that
I mean Okay, we can do better
So tonight, for the first time, we are inviting all of your friends and family to attend the awards with us
Yes
MICHAEL: Yeah
Not bad, right
So let's make this the best Dundies ever
